    <h1>Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ which is living with the results of other people's thinking</h1>
    <h2>If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough.</h2>
    <h3>Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.</h3>
